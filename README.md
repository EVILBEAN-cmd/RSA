# RSA-encryption-decryption

This program can create simple key pairs (public and private), cipher and decipher numbers and find the private key with help of the public key.

All the functions (expecet main) are in the header.h file with comments. One command to run this code in the terminal is:

"g++ main.cpp -include header.h -o main" and "./main" afterwards (both without quotation marks).

Currently the program will crash if you don't enter integers, this will be fixed soon. 
I hope you enjoy this code and I'd love some feedback.

TODOS:
-------------------------------------------------
- [ ] Change inputs in order to only get numbers (maybe new function)
- [ ] Maybe add text for encryption/decryption not just numbers
- [ ] split up code in different files
